## Abstract

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a very common degenerative neurological disorder, and affects about 1% of those older than 60. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a key mechanism involved in the degradation of alpha-synuclein protein, which is abnormally deposited in a misfolded form in the brains of PD patients. We hypothesized that the CMA pathway is dysregulated in PD patients as compared to control. We used RNA-Seq data from the cingulate gyrus, which has been recently identified as a brain region showing promise for identifying early markers of PD [1]. We performed varied analyses of the data which provide good indicators in support of our hypothesis. However, we noticed some imperfections in the data, due to which we validated our main conclusions using extensive data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative database. Our conclusions establish that chaperone-mediated autophagy is a crucial pathway for governing stability of the alpha-synuclein protein and has impaired functioning in the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

## Hypothesis

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is characterized by deposits of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein. A possible reason for this is that these misfolded proteins are not degraded properly, leading to their accumulation in lewy bodies (LB), a phenotypic hallmark of PD. Degradation happens through a mechanism called autophagy, of which chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a type. Hence, defects in autophagy may have the potential to cause abnormal proteins to aggregate. In the case of alpha-synuclein, a few prior studies have suggested that CMA is the major mechanism of destruction of this protein, as opposed to micro- or macro-autophagy, and have also provided some promising early evidence. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is dysregulated in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients.
